## React and Forms

### React Docs - Forms

What is a 'Controlled Component'?

- A **controlled component** is an input form element in React whose value is controlled and set by React as the "single source of truth". With a controlled component, the input's value is *always* driven by the React state of the component.

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.



How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

### The Conditional (Ternary) Operator

Why would we use a ternary operator?

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}```
