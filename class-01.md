## HTML Structure

How we structure webpages is extremely important because it helps the user make sense of the hierarchy of information you're displaying.
HTML is what describes that structure. HTML structure is defined by elements, which are usually comprised of two tags: an opening and a closing.

Opening: `<p>`

Closing: `</p>`

You can imagine tags like containers for information to go in.
They tell you something about the content that's within the tags.
We can further define tags with the use of attributes.
They are made of two parts: the name and value.
Example: `<h1 lang="en">`. *lang* is the name and *en* is the value.
