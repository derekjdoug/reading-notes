# Growth Mindset

To me, the definition of growth mindset is rooted in *contribution*. What do we continually seek to contribute to ourselves and to others?

Things to keep in mind:

- [ ] Embrace challenges
- [ ] Learn from criticism
- [ ] Be inspired by others

Without a growth mindset, we will fail to ***meet our potential***

If you're feeling lost or discouraged, just look back to the list and focus on checking off one item at a time.
- [x] Embrace challenges
- [x] Learn from criticism
- [x] Be inspired by others

I believe in you!üëç
