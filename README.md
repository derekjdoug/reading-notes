# Derek's Notes!

## Who Am I?

Hi, and welcome to my humble page!
My name is Derek Douglas, and I am an aspiring software developer.
My background is as an United States Air Force veteran, serving ten years as an Urdu (a language spoken in Pakistan and India) Cryptologic Linguist and Military Training Instructor.
I don't have professional tech experience, so I'm starting with a clean slate, open-mindset, and hungry to learn.
Basically, I'm ready to tackle my next foreign language!
My priorities during this adventure are to:

- Keep my curiousity *burning* and learn as much as I can
- Connect with my classmates to help each other grow
- Maintain a balance in my life and spend time with my wonderful wife and two daughters.

Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit about me.
