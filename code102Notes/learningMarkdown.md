# GitHub and Markdown Intro

## Week 01 Day 01

We learned an introduction to GitHub *and* Markdown. 
Specifically, we practiced navigating some important areas of the GitHub user interface, and basic Markdown syntax.

For a simple overview (how I *currently* understand it):

- GitHub is a creation platform used for code!
- Markdown is a way to write/stylize/format prose
- They work together and it's important to understand Markdown in order to use GitHub

Sometimes, I felt a bit lost navigating GitHub (especially when I tried to find my website URL a 2nd time), but my knowledge will improve with exposure
