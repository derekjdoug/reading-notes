# Structure Web Pages With HTML

## Week 01 Day 04

Today we took our next steps in coding with HTML.
Before we could write any HTML, however, we need to envision what our end goal will look like.
For that we have a **Wireframe**.

## Wireframes

A **Wireframe** is a simple sketch of the interface of a webpage.
This focuses not only on how a page will look, but how users will process information on the site.
A wireframe can be done a few different ways:

- Whiteboard
- Paper with a marker
- Software

If using paper, a sharpie is a great way to sketch as it doesn't allow the designer to go overboard with details.
Wireframes should be simple!

## HTML

Hypertext Markup Language (**HTML**) is a markup language that defines the structure of content.
Basically, it consists of a series of elements which are used to put content on a page.
A good practice is to write HTML starting from the content you want on the top left of the screen diagonally down and to the right.
An HTML file is composed of elements. Elements contain:

- The opening tag
- The closing tag
- The content
- The element itself

You *can* put elements inside elements inside elements. This is called *nesting*.
Some elements have no content and are called *empty elements*.
An example is the element to embed an image.

I will add the anatomy of an HTML doc as well as commonly used elements at a later time.
