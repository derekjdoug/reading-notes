# Topic Notes

## Week 01

## Day 01

We learned an introduction to GitHub *and* Markdown. 
Specifically, we practiced navigating some important areas of the GitHub user interface, and basic Markdown syntax.

For a simple overview (how I *currently* understand it):

- GitHub is a creation platform used for code!
- Markdown is a way to write/stylize/format prose
- They work together and it's important to understand Markdown in order to use GitHub

Sometimes, I felt a bit lost navigating GitHub (especially when I tried to find my website URL a 2nd time), but my knowledge will improve with exposure

## Day 02

First and foremost, I learned the critical differences between a word processor and a text editor. 
The bottom line is, text editors are designed to make writing code (*and your life*) a little bit easier!
Choosing a text editor is largely personal preference (as long as it has all of the features you need), but they should be free for students!
Some example text editors are:
- Note++
- VS Code
- Atom

Next, I installed a **virtual machine** on my PC that enables me to run Linux (and access our terminal).
In this case, I'm using a distribution called Ubuntu.
There was some trouble shooting needed during the installation process, but it was a great exercise and forced me to use the terminal--and its commands--right off the bat.
Truthfully, I don't even know where to begin in explaining using Linux, but right now most of our efforts are in learning the Command Line Interface.
Instead of using a graphical interface, the CLI enables us to perform the same actions within our computers more efficiently.
Here are some commands that I've learned so far:
- pwd (print working directory) This tells us where we're at within the system
- ls (list) This tells us what is in our current location
- ls -l (long listing) There's a lot to this, but it basically provides more information about what we're seeing
- ls /etc (commands not to list directories, but to list directories' contents)
- ls -a (lists contents of a directory, including hidden files)
- cd (change directory)

Also important to note is the different paths we are able to navigate.
There are two specifically:
1. Relative path: a file or directory that's relative to where we are currently
2. Absolutely path: the same thing in relation to the roof of the file system

Finally, I learned about files.
Basically, everything is a file.
I'll get into this more later, but here are some important notes:
- Linux IS case sensitive
- spaces are valid in files, but we need to be careful to distinguish them from arguments attached to a command
- Linux is an extentionless system
- Linux can also show us hidden files
