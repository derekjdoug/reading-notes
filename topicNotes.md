# Day 01

We learned an introduction to GitHub *and* Markdown. 
Specifically, we practiced navigating some important areas of the GitHub user interface, and basic Markdown syntax.

For a simple overview (how I *currently* understand it):

- GitHub is a creation platform used for code!
- Markdown is a way to write/stylize/format prose
- They work together and it's important to understand Markdown in order to use GitHub

Sometimes, I felt a bit lost navigating GitHub (especially when I tried to find my website URL a 2nd time), but my knowledge will improve with exposure

# Day 02

I learned the differences between a word processor and a text editor. 
The bottom line is, text editors are designed to make writing code (*and your life*) a little bit easier!
Choosing a text editor is largely personal preference (as long as it has all of the features you need), but they should be free for students!
Some example text editors are:
- Note++
- VS Code
- Atom

The rest of this file is a placeholder to expand upon the rest of the reading tomorrow! For now, I must sleep.
