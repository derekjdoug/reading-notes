## Audio, Video, Images

### Images

Here some helpful things to keep in mind for CSS:

- While you *can* control image size in HTML, if you want to resize many images on your page to the same size, using CSS is more effective
- To align images, using the `float` propery is useful
- To center images, you can change their display from `inline` to `block` and either `text-align` or set their left and right margins
- Information on repeating images can be found on page 414. You can repeat along the horizontal and vertical axes or just along the x or y.
- For background images, you can also change the position, and affect multiple background properties at once using the shorthand `background:` to list your values.
- Info on image rollover and sprites can be found on page 417-418. Useful for buttons.
- You can also change the appearance of images with properties like gradients and contrast.

### Practical Information

This chapter covers important information for getting your website found and making it more useful for your users.

**Search Engine Optimization** is critical.
There is on-page and off-page SEO.
On-page SEO relies heavily on the text on your page (between certain HTML tags), so content and semantic organization is key.
Further focus should be given to which keywords you want to include on your site for a search engine to pick up.
3-5 are a good starting point to figure out.

Next up is analytic tools.
One example would be from google, where you can get information such as: what your visitors are looking at, where the visitors are coming from, how many visits you have, unique visits, page views, pages per visit, average time on site, etc.

The rest of the chapter briefly mentions finding a domain and using FTP/third party tools.

### Video and Audio APIs

This page on [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Video_and_audio_APIs) does a fantastic job of breaking down how to incorporate audio and video files on your sites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It is saved for future reference.
