# Activate Web Pages With JavaScript

## Week 01 Day 05

**JavaScript** (JS) is a lightweight compiled programming language that is interpreted "just-in-time".
It's most commonly known as the scripting language for web pages, but other environments that aren't on a browser also use **JS**.
Some examples are:

- Node.js
- Apache CouchDB
- Adobe Acrobat

It's also a whole lot more than I don't know how to describe *yet*, but it is a dynamic language that supports lot of different functional programming styles.
It's also important to note that **JS** is *not* **Java**.
Both are trademarked by Oracle, but the languages are different.

To dumb down the definition: **JS** allows us to implement complex features on web pages.
Whenever a page does more than just sit there and display static information, **JS** is probable involved.
For example:

- content updates
- interactive maps
- music players

**JS** is a part of the 3-layer cakes that comprises web pages.
Here's a great example from [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)
