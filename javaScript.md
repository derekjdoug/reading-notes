# Activate Web Pages With JavaScript

## Week 01 Day 05

**JavaScript** (JS) is a lightweight compiled programming language that is interpreted "just-in-time".
It's most commonly known as the scripting language for web pages, but other environments that aren't on a browser also use **JS**.
Some examples are:

- Node.js
- Apache CouchDB
- Adobe Acrobat

It's also a whole lot more than I don't know how to describe *yet*, but it is a dynamic language that supports lot of different functional programming styles.
It's also important to note that **JS** is *not* **Java**.
Both are trademarked by Oracle, but the languages are different.

To dumb down the definition: **JS** allows us to implement complex features on web pages.
Whenever a page does more than just sit there and display static information, **JS** is probable involved.
For example:

- content updates
- interactive maps
- music players

**JS** is a part of the 3-layer cakes that comprises web pages.
Here's a great example from [Mozilla:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)

![Web Cake](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript/cake.png)

**JS** can do things such as store values inside of variables, operations on strings of text, run code in response to events, and use **Application Programming Interfaces** (APIs) to implement blocks of complex code that would be difficult or impossible to otherwise implement.
They're essentially ready made kits that do complex actions on a web page.

Some other important notes:

- **JS** will usually run in the order it's written (an important idea that can get you into trouble if you're not careful)
- Best practice is *not* to include it in the HTML page, but rather in it's own app.js file.

I will add more to this later as I don't feel I understand the code well enough to include it in these notes!
