## Object-Oriented Programming and HTML Tables

### Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is all about creating models for a specific problem (or problem domain).
It can gives us the framework to program for certain problems that may be recurring or have many instances.
It's good practice to model attributes that are well defined and initialize properties, while also using small methods that focus on doing individual jobs well--again we should be able to use this as a template for many different, and varied, instances.
Create instances with the `new` keyword (this creates a new object that is based on the domain modeling), then a call to which ever constructor function is used to store the data.

### HTML Tables

Tables are just that . . . a table that displays information (think spreadsheet!).
