# Node.JS Refresher

## How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

- You can think of Node as a tool or environment to run JavaScript with. It allows us to use whatever tools or libraries we wish to build our own JavaScript applications with easier. It is a framework.

## What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

- It means that Node allows us to execute JavaScript on our computers instead of in a browser.

## What is Node used for?

- It is used to install and run different build tools that are designed to automate building a modern JavaScript application--why write code that you could automate?

- Used for running JavaScript on the backend/server.

- Helpful for building apps that require real-time interaction or collab--such as chat sites, apps that can be edited live by different users at the same time.

- Nice that you don't have to switch languages between front and back ends.
