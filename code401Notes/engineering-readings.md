# Engineering Readings

## Your Time is Worth $1000/hr

Successful people don't tolerate busywork or distraction. They have a clear vision on their goals, and do what they need, every single day (Reminds me of the 100% principle).

Eliminate busyness, stress, and exhaustion, but do what you do with complete, hard focus.

- People treat you how you teach them

## How to Think Like a Programmer

Programming is all about finding effective ways to problem solve. Problem solving skills are arguably more important than baseline technical skills, and are the first thing that perspective employers will look at. Ineffective problem solving (trial, error, trial error) wastes time. Instead, build a framework to follow when solving problems.

1. **Understand:** Know exactly what is being asked/what the problem is. Write down the problem, doodle a diagram, ask a rubber duck.

2. **Plan:** Write down in steps how you're going to attack the problem. *Do not* dive right in.

3. **Divide:** Do not try to solve one big problem. Break it into sub-problems, which are much easier to solve. Once you've solved all of the sub-problems, connect the dots.

4. **Stuck:** Try to debug, reassess, and research.

5. **Practice:** Practice micro-problem solving.

## How to Solve Programming Problems

- Resist the urge to dive right into coding

Instead:

1. Read the problem 2x
2. Solve manually 3x with sample data
3. Optimize manual steps
4. Write the steps as comments or pseudo code
5. Replace with real code
6. Optimize real code

- 70% of time should be spent in steps 1-3

## 5 Whys

The reading uses the example of Toyota, who have a "go and see" philosphy to solving problems. Meaning that they try to solve the problem at the source instead of people higher up theorizing in a board room.

This 5 Whys philosphy is really pretty simple, and is all about drilling down to the root cause of a problem. All you have to do is ask "Why?" the first time to figure out what the problem is, and then ask "Why?" 4 more times in sucession! Each time, you drill down another layer.

## The Super Mario Effect

- Main takeaway: Don't view failure as a negative!

## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- I bring interpersonal communication and leadership/followership skills through 5 years of experience in Basic Military Training. An environment that requires high level communication, teamwork, and empathy.

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- 5 Whys!
- Plan out my problem solving, using a framework
- View failure as an opportunity
