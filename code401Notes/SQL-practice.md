# SQL Practice

## What is SQL?

SQL is short for *Structured Query Language*. It is a language designed to allow people to query, manipulate, transform, etc. data from a relational database. It's intended to be a fairly simple framework that can provide safe and scalable storage.

To simplify a visualization of a SQL database, it can be thought of as a collection of excel tables. Some of them may relate to each other, and some of them may not.

## SQL Syntax

- To query data, we use SELECT and FROM statements. Very simply:

`SELECT *this data* FROM *this table*`
